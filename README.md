# TriviaGame

## The Assignment
For this assignment I was tasked with making a trivia webpage that utilized timers to track a user's pace

## Tools I used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
JQuery

## What I did
As usual, to start out I coded the HTML, then the first thing I did using JavaScript was setting my variables for time, correct answers, incorrect answers. The next Javascript/JQuery was setting up the timer so it counted down from 30. Then I went through and used the children property to check if the answers the user selected were correct or not upon clicking the "submit" button or the 30 second timer running out, adding to correct if they were right and incorrect if they were not or unanswered. I then used Javascript and JQuery to mostly clear out the page on completion, making way for a new div that would tell the user how many questions they got right. After that I used CSS to style the page.

## Problems I encountered:
The biggest problem I had was that the children property wasn't covered in class and I couldn't find it easily using Google, and I ended up needing to turn to Eric for help. I also tried to use for loops and functions to cut down on my code length but it wasn't working for me so I ended up hard coding just about everything for this assignment, so I know it'll be a blast to read through. Also I couldn't get JQuery working for me to change my CSS so I had to end up using vanilla JavaScript.
